The provided code is a PyQt5 application for generating and visualizing non-overlapping simple polygons. The application allows the user to input the number of polygons to generate and then select start and goal points within the generated polygons. The main window consists of multiple pages managed by a QStackedWidget.

PageA is the initial page where the user inputs the number of polygons to generate. PageB allows the user to select start and goal points within the generated polygons. PageC displays the selected start and goal coordinates and provides an option to show the optimal path from start to goal. PageD visualizes the polygons, start and goal points, and the shortest path between them using matplotlib.

The application utilizes PyQt5 for the GUI components and matplotlib for plotting the polygons and paths. Shapely is used for geometric calculations, such as checking for intersections and computing the shortest path.
